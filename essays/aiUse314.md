### I. Introduction
The use of AI in education has often been viewed negatively due to its potential for facilitating plagiarism across various subjects. For instance, entire essays can be composed by these language models, which may prevent individuals from expressing their own opinions, theories, or research. While these essays might sound eloquent and convenient, they are not always accurate, and the explanations provided may slightly distort the intended message. In my experience in ICS 314, the use of AI has been enlightening as we explored its applications as a software development tool without becoming overly dependent on it. Personally, I have used ChatGPT in this class to help find solutions to challenging problems. It has introduced new approaches to problem-solving and provided code blocks that invariably require verification and a thorough understanding of the generated content. ChatGPT has also been invaluable for proofreading essays and occasionally suggesting better ways to express certain ideas, much like its assistance with coding.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs
     I opted not to use AI, choosing instead to attempt the WODs and watch the screencasts for learning.  
  
  2. In-class Practice WODs

     I did not use AI for these WODs to enhance my learning experience through direct practice.
     
  3. In-class WODs

     Initially, I avoided using AI to challenge myself. However, as the semester progressed, non-use of AI often led to a 'DNF' (Did Not Finish) status, especially in UI design WODs where it was challenging to describe to ChatGPT my exact requirements.

  4. Essays

     I refrained from using AI to compose essays, equating it to plagiarism. However, I occasionally sought help from ChatGPT for improving phrases or sentences. 
  
  5. Final project

      While I have tried using AI in our final project, I found it challenging due to the complex design patterns in Bowfolios, our reference project. In other areas like learning concepts or tutorials, I did not use AI, relying instead on the ample class materials.

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial

       I chose not to use AI for learning specific concepts or tutorials, relying instead on the extensive materials provided in the course.

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

       I used AI only when we were encouraged to see how it would respond.

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question

      I have never used AI for smart-questions as I thought that it would be pointless to have AI ask your own questions. I also did not answer using AI as I never had the opportunity to answer someones question.

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

      I often asked AI for coding examples and advice on approaching problems. 

  10. Explaining code

      I never used AI to explain code because I didn’t see it as necessary. I would instead see documentation or the course materials to understand the code.

  11. Writing code

      Sometimes I used AI to help start coding in WODs, but this wasn’t always effective for more complex tasks. 

  12. Documenting code

      I didn’t use AI for documenting code, as it didn’t seem needed.

  13. Quality assurance

      I never used AI for quality assurance because it never occured to me to use it for this purpose.

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above

      The only other time I used AI was to proofread emails, which helped improve my communication.

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
Using AI in this class has often times given me new perspectives to approach certain problems. It also has made some tasks like debugging a lot faster as well. I feel that AI has enhanced my understanding of software engineering concepts by guiding me to solutions or potential solutions. I also feel that it will continue to improve which will make use of AI a more powerful tool.

### IV. Practical Applications:
I think that using it as a tool for ICS classes could be very valuable. This could maybe be encouraged by making certain lessons and experiences mandatory to do without AI and encourage AI use for other ones.

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:
Throughout this course, the greatest challenge has been using AI for my project, working with large repositories such as Clubs At Manoa. Over-reliance on AI might also result in receiving answers that are slightly off from what is needed.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:
Traditional teaching methods in software engineering focus on structured, repetitive learning, which is effective for knowledge retention but may lack engagement. In contrast, AI-enhanced approaches like using ChatGPT offer interactive and personalized learning experiences that boost engagement and adapt to individual learning styles. However, to develop practical skills effectively, a combination of both traditional methods and AI tools is essential, ensuring thorough understanding and application of concepts.

### VII. Future Considerations:
AI could be a valuable tool not only in ICS but in other subjects as well. It should be used not to plagiarize but to explore ideas or help structure and proofread pre-existing work.


### VIII. Conclusion:
Artificial Intelligence, particularly tools like ChatGPT, has proven to be an invaluable asset in the educational landscape of software engineering. Throughout ICS 314, AI has not only facilitated a deeper understanding of complex concepts but also enhanced the efficiency of learning and problem-solving processes. By integrating AI, we can transform traditional learning environments into more engaging, adaptable, and responsive spaces that cater to individual learning styles and needs. However, it is crucial to strike a balance between AI assistance and traditional learning methods to ensure that students gain a comprehensive understanding of the material without over-relying on technology. Looking forward, the potential of AI in education is immense, promising even greater enhancements in how we learn, understand, and apply knowledge. As we continue to explore and refine these tools, we must remain mindful of ethical considerations, particularly regarding academic integrity and the genuine understanding of coursework. In summary, while AI can significantly augment our educational tools, its integration should be thoughtfully managed to maximize benefits while minimizing potential drawbacks.
