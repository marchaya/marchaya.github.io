### I. Introduction
The use of AI in education has often been viewed negatively due to its potential for facilitating plagiarism across various subjects. For instance, entire essays can be composed by these language models, which may prevent individuals from expressing their own opinions, theories, or research. While these essays might sound eloquent and convenient, they are not always accurate, and the explanations provided may slightly distort the intended message. In my experience in ICS 314, the use of AI has been enlightening as we explored its applications as a software development tool without becoming overly dependent on it. Personally, I have used ChatGPT in this class to help find solutions to challenging problems. It has introduced new approaches to problem-solving and provided code blocks that invariably require verification and a thorough understanding of the generated content. ChatGPT has also been invaluable for proofreading essays and occasionally suggesting better ways to express certain ideas, much like its assistance with coding.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs

     I did not use AI for the experience WODs and would instead try the WOD and watch the screencasts.
     
  3. In-class Practice WODs

     I did not use AI for the practice WODs as I thought that it would help me learn by trying on my own.
     
  5. In-class WODs

     In the beginning of the semester, I would not use AI to challenge myself to solve these problems. However I found that not using AI would often times lead to a DNF     result in the later WODs. I found that the times that using AI was a challenge was for Wods that involved UI design as it was hard to describe to ChatGPT how exactly I wanted something to work or look.

  7. Essays

     I have not used AI for essays as I find it similar to plagarizing. However I have asked ChatGPT occasionally for help to find better phrases or sentences by asking "How could I say ___ in a better way?" 
  9. Final project

  10. Learning a concept / tutorial

       I did not use AI to learn a concept or for a tutorial as there was already plenty of material to learn from in this class.

  12. Answering a question in class or in Discord

      The only times I have used ChatGPT for class discussions was for whenever we were explicitly encouraged to see how AI would respond.

  14. Asking or answering a smart-question

      I have never used AI to ask or answer any of the smart-questions.

  16. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

      In coding, I have definitely used it to ask for examples in Underscore. I have also have given them an idea of what I want to do and ask it how I can go about accomplishing this task. 

  18. Explaining code

      I have never used it to explain code.

  20. Writing code

      In WODs, I have used it to write code by including the prompt. This did not work for some of the WODs with more complex file structures or with more complex tasks. 

  22. Documenting code

      I have not used it for documenting code.

  24. Quality assurance

      I have not used AI for quality assurance

  26. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above

      For the final project, I have been trying to use AI but have found it hard as we have used Bowfolios as a reference and it uses more complex design patterns.
