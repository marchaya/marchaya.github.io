I am in fact a newbie to Javascript and my knowledge of it is still on the come up. I find that in my short experience, Javascript has been a smooth transition. Syntax-wise, it doesn't feel too different compared to C. I think that I need to spend more time going back to the Free Code Camp tutorials since I was only able to rush through the exercises. So far, I think that it is a good programming language from a software engineering for its ease of use and understanding.

As for Athletic Software Engineering and the style of learning, I think that although it is stressful, it could be effective in learning. It is very fast paced with WODs every week but can help me prepare for job interviews and help teach me to stay on my toes more. The one issue I find is that because it is fast paced and stressful, the topics will tend to stay in my mind for a shorter period of time instead of being able to take my time for each subject and prepare for a more traditional exam.

From the first two weeks of classes so far, I can already tell that there will be many interesting aspects to software engineering that I will be learning and look forward to adding this knowledge to my toolbelt. I also find the professional portfolio building both enjoyable and valuable. I know that these are also tools that I will find very useful to my future career and that I will continue using this for as long as I work.
