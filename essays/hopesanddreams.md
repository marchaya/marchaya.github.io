## My Interests
My interests with ICS started with my curiosity for what the field explores. I was curious to learn ways in which coding can be used to assist and advance other fields. The vastness of applications for software engineering overwhelmed me at first and I found it difficult to choose a direction to focus on but my Akamai Internship helped me decide the path I want to take. My internship was focused on the field of Machine Learning and learning the various tools used for my project strengthened my ambition to focus more on this topic. 

## ICS 314
In my ICS 314 class, for which I am writing this essay, I want to gain skills that will help inspire me for future projects. Learning Javascript will help me understand coding from another perspective and further my understanding of the field that is Software Engineering. The creation and interactive use of our professional portfolios will also help build my space where I can present my work which will continue to be an important asset without a doubt. I also hope to also build more connections with my peers who I can continue to keep in touch outside of the class and in the future. 

## The Future
I feel that the skills I gain from my time in ICS 314 and at UH Manoa will carry on deep into my career. I aim to use the skills from the class to develop practical projects, especially in Machine Learning.  I'm excited to see how the coding and software engineering principles I learn here can be applied to real-world problems. This is the beginning of a new semester and I am excited to continue my learning in Software Engineering.
